- training dqn on 1M episodes
- eval is done in bb/hand

post training thoughts:

plays about even against itself, good sign. Plays well against random bot

Against human (jake), ai did very poorly. Seems to not fold very often, really only
folds against all ins. Maybe the model thinks the negative reward of folding is never
worth losing the positive potential of staying in the hand??

Going into the recorded 100 hand game, I kinda had the strategy figured out. Will
be interesting to see how rob does against it in his first run.

Jake avg win: 21.36
Rob avg win: 14.83

AI vs random: 50 trials of 10k games
